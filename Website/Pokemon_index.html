        <h1> Pokemon Tier List Changes Across Generations </h1>
        <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

        <p>A childhood game that many remember or still play to this day, Pokemon, is known
            for its constant expansions into different regions or generations if you strictly play
            Nintendo's Pokemon video games. There's boundless amounts of questions one can ask about 
            the Pokemon's stats, evolution, type, moveset, and so onl however, most of these visualizations
            would be fairly predictable and somewhat meaningless. Thus we could theoretically propose questions like:
        </p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Are there any patterns in the distribution of base stats across different generations?</li>
            <li>Are there any patterns in the distribution of egg cycles among different evolutionary lines?</li>
            <li>Do certain abilities appear more frequently among heavier or taller/egg types of Pokemon?</li>
        </ol>
              
        <p>Such questions take a deeper look at trends between Pokemon in between different classifications 
            rather than simply limiting the flow of information to within the same category. This is another 
            factor of what makes exploring Pokemon data so interesting as layers of complexity can be methodically 
            added to make the results of the final visualization all the more interesting to decipher. With regards 
            to our approach, using generational data in accordance with the commonly used Pokemon simulator, Pokemon Showdown, 
            we should expectedly yield a plethora of compelling visualizations and results.
        </p>
    
        <p>As we delve into the depths of Pokémon data analysis, we recognize the importance of exploring beyond the surface to reveal 
            hidden connections and patterns. By examining Pokemon characteristics across generations, we not only gain insights into 
            the evolution of the franchise but also contribute to a broader understanding of complex systems and phenomena. Through 
            our research, we aim to uncover valuable insights that not only enrich our understanding of Pokemon dynamics but also 
            serve as a testament to the enduring appeal and cultural significance of the Pokemon phenomenon.

        <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>
    
        <p> Our analysis makes use of thee total datasets. The first of which is 
            from Kaggle which provided which contains general information
            on a Pokemon's name, type, overall stats, abilities, etc. For 
            our second and third datasets, we pulled this from a GitHub repository 
            where we took a formats-data.ts file which contains tier-related information 
            for each Pokemon across generations, and a pokedex.ts file which provided in-depth 
            information on each Pokemon's stats. Below we'll be summarizing what some of the 
            tiers mean, so for future reference, you may revisit this table at any time if you 
            are confused (hint: Smogon is a great resource for this as well!):

            <h3>Static Visualizations</h3>
            <h4>Violin Plot: Complete Stat Distributions</h4>
                <div class='image'>
                    <iframe src="complete.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class='text'>
                    <p> The first of the violin plots depicts the complete stat distributions 
                        across all 7 Pokemon generations. This plot offers a clear overview of 
                        how total base stats are distributed, allowing for the identification 
                        of outliers and understanding of statistical characteristics such as 
                        central tendency and variability. As you may tell from a glance the overall 
                        shape of each violin visualization is very similar in shape, with a high 
                        concentration of Pokemon ranging between the 400s to 500s and the high being 
                        in the 700s to 800s. This indicates that overall the distribution of Pokemon 
                        base total stats do not fluctuate much. With that said, it is likely that the 
                        developers do not favor power creep and want Pokemon within each generation to 
                        always have similar stats and that other factors are favored. Some factors may 
                        be design, typage, abilities, and movesets which are all more interesting 
                        conceptually than increasing numbers. 
                    </p>

            <h4>Violin Plot: Competitive Stat Distributions</h4>
                <div class='image'>
                    <iframe src="competitive.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class='text'>
                    <p> The second of the violin plots depicts the competitive stat distributions 
                        across alsl 7 Pokemon generations. The main difference from the previous violin 
                        plot is that this visualization omits Fully Evolved and Little Cup Pokemon, so 
                        that people have a better idea of how total Pokemon stats impact the competitive 
                        scene. With that said, all violin visualization for the most part have the same shape 
                        where the center area has the greatest concentration of Pokemon and narrows at the top 
                        and bottom. Analysis-wise, we see that the median competitive stats is greater than 
                        in the complete stats which is to be expected, ranging from 450 to 550 total. Something 
                        else to take notice of is that the highs and lows of each violin visualization is also 
                        not as drastic. The reason for not seeing low, lows is mainly because Pokemon with low stats 
                        would already have an immediate disadvantage as they won't dish out as much damage or be able 
                        to take as much damage regardless if they have a good ability or moveset. On the other hand, the 
                        high, highs are likely banned since they are likely legendary Pokemon or mega evolutions. Although 
                        some legendaries that may not have as strong movesets may still be open to be used.

            <h4>Bar Plot: Competitive Composition</h4>
                <div class='image'>
                    <iframe src="___.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

                <div class='text'>
                    <p> The bar plot visualization created is used to show the Distribution of Pokemon in OU (Overused). As 
                        one can see it is split by generations, and with each generation the distribution of OU is calculated 
                        for each new generation that is added. With the release of a new generation there tends to a fairly even 
                        split where the Pokemon of the new generation also rise to the OU-tier. The only sole exception would be 
                        generation 4, where Pokemon of that generation quickly took many of the OU placements. It also stays very 
                        consistent even after new generations are introduced and managed to even take the top spot on many occassions. 
                        That said, generation 6 on its release was unsuccessful showing very few placement in the OU-tier.

            <h4>Sankey Diagram: Flow of Gen 1 Over time</h4>
                <div class='center'>
                    <iframe src="sankey.html" width="125%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class='text'>
                    <p> The final of our static visualizations is the sankey diagram. This diagram maps how generation 1 Pokemon shift in tiers 
                        over the generations. Over time it is evident that new gnerations added to the sankey diagram don't cause major flucations 
                        in tiers as the connections between each node early on aren't extremely wavy, indicating that very minimal tier list changes 
                        occur. Note that there are exceptions, namely in generation 4 to 6 where the connections between some of the nodes start shifting 
                        and spliting a lot more than in the previous generations. One example of this can be seen in generation 5 OU, where the two connections 
                        that initially flowed into generation 5 split off into 4 connections. All and all, this visualization can easily show how 
                        often Pokemon leave or enter the competitive meta, but the user will still need to do proper research to better understand 
                        why Pokemon within a certain generation falls off or rises to the top of the tier list.

                <div class='text'>
                    <p> This visualization shows Pokemon average stat changes over generations. This visualization was mainly used to see if power creep 
                        is a common theme in Pokemon and whether stats were going up over time; however, as previously mentioned, the developers 
                        do not seem to favor this path at all and want balance between all generations. Regardless, just from analyzing the trends of the 
                        individual unique stats across the generations, we can see that there are several instances like in generation 7 where attack had 
                        a higher average than the other generations, and just overall the increase in stats are minimal and the difference wouldn't 
                        amount to greater than 10 from one generation to the next.

                <div class='text'>
                    <p> This visualization illustrates each individual Pokemon by generation and categorizes them depending on their tiers. To interact with 
                        the visualization, you can hover over individual data points to reveal detailed information about each Pokémon, including its name, 
                        generation, tier, types, abilities, and base stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Additionally, 
                        you can select specific Pokémon from the dropdown menu to highlight and focus on them within the scatter plot. The color of each point 
                        represents the tier of the Pokémon according to the custom color scheme provided. This visualization offers insights into how Pokémon are 
                        prioritized across generations based on their statistical attributes and tier classifications. It complements the Sankey diagram by providing 
                        a deeper dive into individual Pokémon characteristics, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how and why certain Pokémon transition between 
                        tiers over time. Since this scatter plot doesn't directly illustrate tier list changes, utilizing multiple scatter plots over different time periods 
                        can help piece together a comprehensive narrative of the evolving metagame dynamics.

            <h3>Conclusions & Future Work</h3>
    
            <p>
                To summarize some of our main finds, the first would have to 
                be regarding OU (Overused) Pokemon over the generations. There is an 
                exponential trend towards the negative as expected; however, we see 
                that generation 4 stays at or near the top from its release to the 
                present generations as well. Hence we may consider doing more future 
                research to better understand what is so unique or future proof about 
                generation 4 Pokemon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the competitive usage of Pokemon within each generation has 
                relatively the same highs and lows in terms of total stats, but with 
                regards to competitive play, many players use Pokemon around 450 - 550 
                total stats range. This is likely due to the Pokemon of higher stats being 
                banned, or that Pokemon within the 450 - 550s range have better abilities or 
                movesets that allow them to stay competitive. With regards to future work, 
                we may consider doing a deeper dive on a Pokemon's ability and moveset to 
                better understand its impact on competitve play.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The last of the findings was in the sankey diagram where we could generalize 
                that high-tier or OU-tier Pokemon rarely move from their positions. The same 
                can be said for low-tier Pokemon, which is something expected. The main surprise 
                was due to generations 5 and 6 shaking up the meta a lot as we see many tier changes 
                as the connections in between the nodes split off more frequently. If we were to continue 
                this project, we may consider investigating more into why this disruption in status quo occurred. 
                Some methods may include creating more specialized visualizations to specifically ask 
                questions about the generation 5 and 6 Pokemon.
